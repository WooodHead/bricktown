# Bricktown

The better version of meet_me_at found on my github. 

This version demonstrates some of the newer technologies I've been learning
that were not in the requirements of the last project. 

We use a GraphQL server to demonstrate flexible server calls with caching
enabled by apolloEngine. 

The frontend will be VueJS components and I'm considering adding Vuex for
completion. This project will serve as a future reference for more advanced
projects in the future.
